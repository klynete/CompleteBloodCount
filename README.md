# Object Detection using Faster R-CNN for Blood Smear Images

This repository contains code for performing object detection on a dataset of blood smear images using Jupyter notebooks. The objective of the task is to detect and classify three different cell types: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets.

We have used the Faster R-CNN algorithm to perform object detection on the images. The Faster R-CNN model is a popular deep learning model for object detection, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of object detection tasks. We trained the model on a dataset of 300 blood smear images, which has been annotated with the locations of the three different cell types.

The code in this repository includes the necessary Jupyter notebooks for training the Faster R-CNN model on the blood smear dataset, as well as for evaluating the performance of the trained model. 

We have also included pre-trained weights for the Faster R-CNN model, which can be used for inference on new blood smear images.
